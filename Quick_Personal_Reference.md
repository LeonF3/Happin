## Key Decisions

1. **Your Current Skill Level?**
   - [ ] New to programming → 9+ months learning first
   - [ ] Web developer (no React) → 4 months learning
   - [ ] Web developer (know React) → 2-3 months learning
   - [ ] Mobile developer → Ready to start

2. **Time Available?**
   - [ ] Full-time (40 hrs/week) → Faster delivery
   - [ ] Part-time (20 hrs/week) → Double the timeline

3. **Client Expectations?**
   - [ ] Need it fast → Hybrid approach first
   - [ ] Quality over speed → Learn first, then build
   - [ ] Budget flexible → Subcontract complex parts

---

## Red Flags to Avoid

❌ **Don't promise 3 months if you need 6 months to learn**
❌ **Don't charge senior rates if you're learning**
❌ **Don't skip building practice apps first**
❌ **Don't hide your experience level from client**

---

## Green Flags to Follow

✅ **Be transparent about learning curve**
✅ **Add 30-50% buffer to timeline estimates**
✅ **Build 1-2 practice apps before client work**
✅ **Charge lower rate during learning phase**
✅ **Consider subcontracting complex features**

---

## Bottom Line

**If you're new to mobile:**
- Start with hybrid app ($3-6K, 2-3 weeks)
- Learn React Native (2-4 months)
- Build native app ($30-60K, 4-6 months)
- **Total:** $33-66K over 5-7 months

**If you're experienced:**
- Build React Native app directly
- **Charge:** $50-100K
- **Timeline:** 3-6 months
