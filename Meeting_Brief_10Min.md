## 🎯 KEY QUESTIONS TO ASK CLIENT

### Technical Access:
- [ ] Do you have Supabase credentials/access?
- [ ] Can I inspect the database schema?
- [ ] What's the current API structure?
- [ ] Any existing documentation?

### Scope & Requirements:
- [ ] Is the matching algorithm documented?
- [ ] Any specific location service requirements?
- [ ] Push notification preferences (Expo vs native)?
- [ ] Image upload size limits/preferences?

### Business:
- [ ] Timeline expectations?
- [ ] Budget range?
- [ ] Payment structure (milestones, hourly, fixed)?
- [ ] Who's the decision maker?
- [ ] Any deadlines (launch date, investor demo)?

### Future:
- [ ] Maintenance/support expectations?
- [ ] Future features planned?
- [ ] iOS and Android both needed?

---

## 🚩 RED FLAGS TO WATCH FOR

### Technical:
- ❌ No database access
- ❌ Undocumented matching algorithm
- ❌ Vague requirements
- ❌ Unrealistic timeline (< 1 month for full)

### Business:
- ❌ Unclear budget
- ❌ Scope creep potential
- ❌ Payment issues (want to pay after completion only)
- ❌ Multiple decision makers (conflicting feedback)

---

## 💡 TALKING POINTS

### Strengths to Emphasize:
- ✅ UI is 100% complete (saves $5k-$8k)
- ✅ Clear feature requirements from web app
- ✅ Supabase simplifies backend work
- ✅ React experience = quick React Native learning curve

### Challenges to Acknowledge:
- ⚠️ Real-time features add complexity
- ⚠️ Matching algorithm needs clear logic
- ⚠️ Testing on both iOS and Android
- ⚠️ Learning React Native (but manageable with React background)

---

## 📊 COMPLEXITY ASSESSMENT

**Level:** Medium-High

**Why:**
- Real-time chat and notifications
- Complex matching logic
- Location-based features
- Social features (friends, invitations)
- Multiple user interactions

**Not Simple Because:**
- Not just CRUD operations
- Real-time synchronization
- Complex business logic (matching)
- Multiple integrations

---

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED APPROACH

### Option 1: Fixed Price (Recommended)
- **MVP:** $30,000 (3-4 weeks)
- **Full:** +$20,000 (additional 3-4 weeks)
- **Total:** $50,000
- **Payment:** 30% upfront, 40% at MVP, 30% at completion

### Option 2: Hourly (If scope unclear)
- **Rate:** $80/hour
- **Estimate:** 300 hours = $24,000
- **Payment:** Weekly or bi-weekly

### Option 3: Phased Fixed
- **Phase 1:** $28,000 (MVP)
- **Phase 2:** $18,000 (Full features)
- **Total:** $46,000

---

## 📝 WHAT TO BRING UP

1. **UI is Done:** Emphasize this saves significant time/cost
2. **Clear Scope:** Web app provides good reference
3. **Realistic Timeline:** 6-8 weeks for quality work
4. **Supabase Advantage:** Faster than custom backend
5. **Your React Experience:** Quick learning curve for RN

---

## ⚡ QUICK DECISION FRAMEWORK

**If they want:**
- **Fixed price:** Offer $45,000 (full) or $30,000 (MVP first)
- **Hourly:** $80/hour, estimate 300 hours
- **Faster timeline:** Add 20-30% premium
- **Just MVP:** $30,000, then negotiate full features

**Payment Terms:**
- Fixed: 30% upfront, 40% milestone, 30% completion
- Hourly: Weekly or bi-weekly invoicing

## 🎤 OPENING STATEMENT (30 seconds)

*"I've completed the UI for all 8 screens based on your web app. The remaining work is backend integration with Supabase - authentication, plans management, friends system, matching algorithm, real-time chat, and location services. Based on the scope, I estimate 6-8 weeks for full implementation. I'd like to understand your timeline and budget expectations, and get access to your Supabase setup to assess the database structure."*
