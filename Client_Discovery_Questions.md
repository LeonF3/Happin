## Red Flags to Watch For

⚠️ **Client says "just like [competitor app]"** - Ask for specifics
⚠️ **Unrealistic timeline** - Push back, explain constraints
⚠️ **Vague requirements** - Ask for concrete examples
⚠️ **No budget discussion** - Insist on budget range
⚠️ **"We'll figure it out as we go"** - Insist on scope definition
⚠️ **No access to codebase** - Red flag, need to assess
⚠️ **Multiple decision makers** - Clarify approval process

---
