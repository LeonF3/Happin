## 7. Recommended Approach for Happin.social

### Recommended: Cross-Platform Development (React Native or Flutter)

**Rationale:**
1. **Social media apps** benefit from cross-platform frameworks that handle real-time features well
2. **Cost-effective** compared to full native while maintaining good performance
3. **Faster time-to-market** than full native development
4. **Single codebase** reduces maintenance overhead
5. **Good balance** between performance, features, and cost

### Alternative: Progressive Web App (PWA) Enhancement
Consider enhancing the existing web app with PWA features first:
- Offline functionality
- App-like experience
- Installable on home screen
- Push notifications (with limitations)
- **Cost:** $5,000 - $15,000
- **Timeline:** 1-2 months

This could be a stepping stone before full native development.
