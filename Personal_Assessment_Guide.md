## Risk Assessment

### Risks of Learning While Building:
- ⚠️ **Timeline delays** (add 30-50% buffer)
- ⚠️ **Code quality issues** (may need refactoring later)
- ⚠️ **Client frustration** if timeline slips
- ⚠️ **Burnout** from learning + building simultaneously

### Mitigation Strategies:
- ✅ **Be transparent** with client about learning curve
- ✅ **Add buffer time** to estimates
- ✅ **Charge lower rate** during learning phase
- ✅ **Build practice apps first** (recommended)
- ✅ **Consider subcontracting** complex features

---

## Alternative: Subcontracting Strategy

### If You're New to Mobile:
1. **You handle:** Project management, design, web app integration
2. **Subcontract:** Native mobile development to experienced developer
3. **You learn:** By reviewing code and working alongside

**Your Role:** Project manager/coordinator
**Your Charge:** $40,000 - $80,000 (markup on subcontractor)
**Your Time:** 2-3 months (management + learning)
**Subcontractor Cost:** $25,000 - $50,000

**Net Profit:** $15,000 - $30,000 while learning

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Be Honest About Your Skills:** Don't overpromise
2. **Factor in Learning Time:** Add 30-50% buffer if learning
3. **Start Small:** Consider hybrid approach first
4. **Practice First:** Build 1-2 practice apps before client work
5. **Charge Appropriately:** Lower rate if learning, market rate if experienced
6. **Consider Team:** Subcontract complex parts if needed
